He looked down a little hole.

The **rabbits** said, "This is our home! Look next door."

He looked down a big hole.

The **fox** said, "This is my home! Look next door."

He looked up in the tree.

The **owls** said, "Whoo-oo! This is our home! Look next door."

It was a cold, dark night and the wind was **blowing**.

The **hedgehog** looked up at the old barn. The **bats** said, "This is our home. But look down, Ned!"

Ned looked down and there was a big pile of leaves.

Ned said, "My home!" and he went to sleep all winter.
