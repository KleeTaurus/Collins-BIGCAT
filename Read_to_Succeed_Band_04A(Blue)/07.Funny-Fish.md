Three **funny fish** were **swimming** in the **sea**.

One **funny fish** said, "Look at me!"

"I am **bright** and **funny** and red."

"I am the **best fish** here," it said.

Then a big **fish** came and **swish**, **swish**, **swish** ...

That was the end of the **funny** red **fish**.

Two **funny fish** were **swimming** in the **sea**.

One **funny fish** said, "Look at ME! I am yellow - as **bright** as the sun!"

Then the big **fish** came and ... Yum, yum, yum!

One **funny fish** was **swimming** in the **sea**.

It said, "No one ever looks at me."

Then **along** came the big **fish** - oh, dear me.

The **funny fish** said, "He can't see me! I can hide. I can look like a **stone**, so the big bad fish **leaves** me **alone**!"
