![logo](./09.Mojo-and-Weeza-and-The-Funny-Thing.jpg)

Mojo and Weeza found a **funny** thing.

Mojo said, "I know what it is! It's a **boat**."

But the **boat** didn't float.

Weeza said, "I know what it is! It's a **rocket**."

They counted ...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... BLAST OFF!

But the **rocket** didn't take off.

Mojo said, "I know what it is! It's a **parachute**."

He climbed up a tree and jumped. But the **parachute** didn't work.

Weeza said, "I know what it is! It's a **tent**."

He lay down under it, but the **funny** thing was too small.

Then it started raining and that was when Mojo said, "I KNOW WHAT IT IS!"

Mojo turned the **funny** thing around and it filled with rain. Then he got in.

Mojo said, "It's a **bath**."

Weeza said, "Of course it is!"

And that's what the **funny** thing was ... well, sort of.
