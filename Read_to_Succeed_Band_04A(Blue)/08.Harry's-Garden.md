### 08. Harry's Garden

![logo](./08.Harry's-Garden.jpg)

Find something to make your garden in. I used an old **wheelbarrow**.

**Check** that it is at least 35 centimetres deep.

**Check** that it has small holes in the **bottom**.

Put some little stones on the **bottom**.

Then put some **soil** on the stones.

**Plants** need water, so **water** the **soil**.

**Choose** some **plants** for your garden.

Where do you want to put your **plants**?

Dig a hole for each **plant**.

> Don't forget to put gloves on.

Put a **plant** in the hole. Fill the rest of the hole with **soil**.

> Be gentle with the roots.

**Check** that the **plants** are firm in the **soil**.

Put **bark chippings** on **top** of the **soil**. Don't forget to keep **watering** the **plants**.

> Bark chippings keep the soil damp.

This is my garden. Which **plants** will you grow in your garden?
