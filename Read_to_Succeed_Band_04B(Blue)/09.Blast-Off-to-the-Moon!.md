### 09. Blast Off to the Moon!

![logo](./09.Blast-Off-to-the-Moon!.jpg)

We have always looked up at the Moon and wanted to get there.

First, we had to go up into **space**, but things kept going wrong.

At last we sent a rocket into **space**. It had a **satellite** on it.

Next we sent animals into **space**.

After that, we sent the first man and the first woman into **space**.

**Space travellers** are called **astronauts**.

**Astronauts** have to wear a **spacesuit**.

In **space** everything seems to float.

**Astronauts** eat special food and drink from special cups.

They don't want their dinner to float away.

At last **astronauts** landed on the Moon and began to explore.

There is no wind on the Moon, so their footprints are still there.
