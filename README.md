# Collins-BIGCAT

## What is Big Cat?

Collins Big Cat is a whole-school reading programme that provides complete support for primary reading. Children will become fluent readers through hundreds of high-quality fiction and non-fiction banded books by award winning authors and illustrators. In-depth teaching resources support you in developing and assessing key reading skills at all stages from early reading through to phonics, to guided, whole-class and independent reading for more confident readers.

You can take the overview of KS1 guided reading book bands [here](Guide_to_the_Book_Bands.pdf), and I strongly recommend you to buy the paper version at [jd.com](https://item.jd.com/12207070.html).
