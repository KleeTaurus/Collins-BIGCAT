### 06. Mojo and Weeza and the New Hat

![logo](./06.Mojo-and-Weeza-and-the-New-Hat.jpg)

Mojo and Weeza looked very **smart**. Mojo had new shoes and Weeza had a new hat.

Then there was a gust of wind and Weeza's new hat blew away.

"My new hat!" said Weeza. "It's gone!"

"Where to?" asked Mojo.

Weeza looked around.

"There! By those rocks!" he said.

But it wasn't Weeza's new hat. It was a pan.

"There! Up that tree!" said Mojo.

But it wasn't Weeza's new hat.

It was a bird's nest.

"There! Down that **hole**!" said Mojo.

But it wasn't Weeza's new hat.

It was a **turtle**.

Weeza sat down by the **mud hole**. Then Mojo saw Weeza's new hat.

"There!" he shouted.

Both of them sploshed through the **mud** go get the hat.

"That's better", said Weeza, as he put his new hat back on.

The two of them looked **smart** again ... well, almost.
