"I wish I had someone to **talk** to," said Bill.

The door **opened**.

A **giant bottom** came in and sat down.

Two **legs** came in and **joined** on to the **bottom**, and then ...

... a **tummy** came in and sat down on the **bottom**.

A **chest turned** up to join the **tummy**, and then...

... in came two **arms**, which **fitted** on to the **chest**.

Then a big **head** came in and sat down on top of the lot!

"Well, hello there!" said Bill.

After that, it was **TALK TALK TALK TALK**, all day long.
