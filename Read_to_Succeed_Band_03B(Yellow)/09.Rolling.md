### 09. Rolling

![logo](./09.Rolling.jpg)

There's a hill that I know

Where we all love to go, When the days are clear and blue.

We **climb** right to the top

And down we all flop, Then here is what we do.

We lie flat as flat in the soft green grass, Our hands down by our sides,

And we roll like round, fat **barrels**

Down the slope of that green hill side.

And the **whole** world turns around us

As we all roll round and round,

And the sky spins above our heads

As we **bounce** along the **ground**.

And who'll get to the bottom first?

Will it be Ann or Lee?

Or maybe Tome or Sean or Jane,

Or maybe even me?

And yes it's me, I got there first,

So I shout to Tome and Jane,

And shout to Sean and Lee and Ann,

"Let's do it over again."

So we all **climb** back

To the top of our hill

And go rolling down again.

Yes, over and over and over and over

And over and over

AGAIN.
