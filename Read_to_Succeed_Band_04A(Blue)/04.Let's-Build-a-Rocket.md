### 04. Let's Build a Rocket

![logo](./04.Let's-Build-a-Rocket.jpg)

I'm **building** a **rocket**, as soon as I'm done, I'm taking my friends on a trip to the **Sun**.

But what do you **mean** that the **Sun** is too hot?

Oh well, I suppose I'll just pick a new spot.

I'm **building** a **rocket**, I'm finishing soon, and I'm taking my friends on a trip to the **Moon**!

But what do you **mean** that the **Moon** has no **air**? Oh well, I suppose I'll just pick a new spot.

I'm **building** a **rocket**, it's going to fly, I'm taking my friends wap up **high**.

But what do you **mean** when you ask how will it land?

This **rocket** is harder to **build** than I planned.
