![logo](./05.Percy-and-the-Badger.jpg)

Percy the Park Keeper was in the park.

He saw his friend the badger.

Percy said, "Hello. You do look **muddy**!"

Percy had an idea.

He **got out** his old tin **bath**.

Percy said, "Come and have a **bath**."

The badger said, "Oh, no!"

He didn't want a **bath**.

Percy **got out** his jug and his **bath** cap.

He said, "Where's that badger?"

The badger had gone.

Percy looked and looked...

...but he couldn't find the badger at all.

Then Percy had another idea.

He said, "The badger doesn't want a **bath**, but I do."

He got into the **bath**!

Percy said, "Where is that badger?"

**CRACK**! What was that?

The badger fell out of a tree into the **bath**!

**SPLASH**!

Percy laughed. "Well, well! You are having a **bath**, after all!"
