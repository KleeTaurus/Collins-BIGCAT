### 01. Colours

![logo](./01.Colours.jpg)

I went to the **art** show and I looked at the **paintings**.

There were lots of **colours** in the **paintings** and I began to **imagine** ...

... what if the world was all **yellow**?

There are lots of **different yellows** ...

... or what if everything was **red**?

There are lots of **different reds** ...

... or what if everything was **blue**?

Can you **imagine** a world where everything is **blue**?

Then I had an idea.

The world isn't just **red** or **yellow** or **blue**.

It's a **mixture** of all these **colours** and I wanted to try them out.

I went home and I did my own **paintings**. Why don't you play with **colours**, too?

Try out just one, and then add lots more.
