You grow bigger and stronger, and you all look different.

# Teeth change

You don't have any teeth when you are born.

First teeth are small but strong.

They start to fall out when you are five or six years old. Then adult teeth grow.

# Growing stronger

You become stronger as you grow. You can walk, you can jump. You can do anything!
