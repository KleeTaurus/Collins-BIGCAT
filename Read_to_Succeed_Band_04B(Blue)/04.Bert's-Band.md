Bert's Band **won** the Band Cup. They played:

OOMPAH-BANG-BANG-TING-A-LING!

They played all the way **home** on the bus.

OOMPAH-BANG-BANG-TING-A-LING!

They got off the bus at **midnight**.

Bert **told** his band, "Take off your **socks** and your **boots**."

The band asked, "What for?"

Bert said, "So we won't wake **anyone** up!"

The took off their **socks** and their **boots**.
