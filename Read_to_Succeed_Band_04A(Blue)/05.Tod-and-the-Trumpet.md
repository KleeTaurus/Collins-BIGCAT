### 05. Tod and the Trumpet

![logo](./05.Tod-and-the-Trumpet.jpg)

Tod likes to hide **inside** his shell when he's feeling **shy**.

Or when it's time to tidy up.

**Inside** his shell, Tod reads, draws and plays the **trumpet**.

At school, **nobody** can share his books.

**Nobody** can see his drawings.

**Nobody** can hear him play the **trumpet**.

Tod sits all on his own.

After lunch, **everyone** has an **instrument** on their desk to play.

Tod has a BIG, SHINYï¼ŒYELLOW **TRUMPET**!

It is too big to fit in his shell.

Slowly Tod stretches his head out, takes a deep breath and ...

HHHHOOOOOOOONNNNNKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!

It isn't so scary out of his shell, after all.

Now Tod only goes back in to hide when it's time to tidy up!
