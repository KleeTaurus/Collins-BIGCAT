### 03. The Steam Train

![logo](./03.The-Steam-Train.jpg)

Gosh, I wish I were a bus,

It's much less work

And much less fuss.

I should like that,

I should like that,

De-deedle-dee

De-diddle-dum,

Just look at me

'Cause here I come.

Pain in my back, **aches** in my **joints**,

Tickerty-tack, here are the **points**.

Diddly-dee, diddly dee,

Diddly WIDDLY diddly dee!

Far to go? Not very far.

Little black **tunnel** ...

... Tickerty WHAAAH!

Oh what a train ride,

We're nearly there,

We're nearly there.

And now I'd better slow right down,

In half a mile we reach the town.

Then you'll **paddle** and **splash** in the sea,

And have ice cream and cake for tea.

But gosh I'm tired,

Oh gosh I'm tired,

Hohhh

GOSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH
